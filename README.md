# Digital Electronics - JK-Flip-Flop
## About
<p>This project was built along with the Laboratory Digital Electronics at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Regensburg (OTH Regensburg), Bavaria, Germany. The simulation of the JK-Flip-Flop with AMD Vivado is the focus of the project.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a truth table summarizing the operation of a JK flip-flop with 2 digital signals J und K as an inputs and the clock signal CLK:</p>

## Simulation
<p>After creating a testbench for this project, you can see how the output Q (as digital signal) changes depending on the values of the inputs J and K when the rising edge of the clock comes.</p>
